	<h1>What are These Websites?</h1>
		<p> I operate 3 webservers: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>My professional site, hosting biographical information, Curricula Vitae, portfolio,etc</li>
			<li>My informal blog (this website)</li>
			<li>A self hosted Git repository using Stagit front-end</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>How is This Operated?</h2>
	<h3>Why Vultr?</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.vultr.com/">Vultr</a> is a Virtual Private Service, which leases out virtual machines to run your servers on. </p>
	<p>Vultr has a variety of options as low as $2.50 USD, and in many cases a server costs just as much (and often less) than an Amazon Prime or Disney Plus subscription</p>
	<p>One of the primary issues with hosting on your own server is that Internet Service Providers sometimes block the ports necessary for HTTPS and TLS on residential systems, and that port-forwarding may render your home network vulnerable</p>
	<h3>Why OpenBSD</h3>
	<p>I chose <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/index.html">OpenBSD</a> for two reasons: it is not Linux, and it is optimized for security</p>

	<p>I use GNU/Linux on both my workstation and laptop, and while I do enjoy using Linux, it is refreshing to use a different operating system. There is not much of a learning curve in OpenBSD, as most of the administrative work and commands are similar. OpenBSD also consumes less overhead, and prefers the public domain Korn Shell over Bash.</p>

	<p>Linux is a general purpose operating system, and because of this, is designed with portability/modularity, and ease of use. On the other hand, OpenBSD is designed strictly for security (not necessarily anonymity, as many people conflate the two), even if this takes away from ease of use</p>

	<p>OpenBSD uses <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">HTTPD</a>, its own in house webserver, as well as PF, its one-of-a-kind firewall service</p>

	<p>Unlike Github Pages, I can use JavaScript, primarily MathJax and JSMol</p>
	<h2>Why Does This Look Like a 1999 GeoCities Website?</h2>

	<p>These websites are designed like this to be easy to read and lightweight in resource consumption, as to not consume all of my VPS bandwidth</p>
