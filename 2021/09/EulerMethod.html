	<h1> Use of Euler's Method in Numerical Analysis</h1>
	<h2>What is Euler's Method?</h2>
	<p>The vast majority of differential equations cannot be solved by guessing or with integrative techniques in an elementary fashion. We must develop a means to approximating these solutions.</p>
	<p>This method of numerical approximation was developed by Leonhardt Euler, a Swiss mathemetician</p> 
	<p>This method involves the development of a polygonal curve that roughly resembles the differential equation that we wish to approximate. This is accomplished as shown below </p>

	<p>$$ y' = f(x,y) \ with \ y(x) = y_{i} $$ </p>
	<p>$$ y_{i+1} = y_i + h*f(x_i,y_i) $$ </p>
	<p>$$ x = x_i + h $$ </p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>Given the following information: </p>
		<p>$$\frac{dy}{dx} = xy , \  y(0) = 1, \   h = .1 $$ for two steps </p>
		<p>$$ y_{.1} = 1 + .1(0)  = 1 $$ </p>
		<p>$$ y_{.2} = 1 + .1((.1)(1)) = 1.01 $$ </p>

		<p> y(2) is approximately 1.01 </p>
	<h2>Computing Euler's Method, Pseudocode Example</h2>
		<pre style="align:left">
		<code style="display:block;white-space:pre-wrap;">
		<b>float </b> xinit, yinit, xVal stepSize
		<b>equation</b> diffEq 
		<b>function</b> EulerMethod(xinit,yinit,stepSize,diffEq):
			<b>for</b> iteration in range(xVal):			#iterate to account for stepSize
				yTemp = yinit + (stepSize * diffEq)	#Euler Function
				yinit = yTemp				#set yinit to yTemp
				xinit = xinit + stepSize 		#set xinit for next iteration 
				return ynew
			print(xVal,ynew)
