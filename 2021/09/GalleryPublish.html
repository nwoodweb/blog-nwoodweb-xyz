	<h1>Workflow for Publishing to Gallery</h1>
	<h2>Compression</h2>
	<p>It is in our interest to save server storage space, using our VPS it is best to choose a lossy file format, with my preference being JPEG</p>
	<p>If we are storing on a workstation or a NAS, it is in our interest to store our images in lossless raster formats or extensible vector formats</p> 
	<br>
	<p>I use the Gnu Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to first compress the lossless files at maximum compresion, then reimport the compressed lossless file to then export in JPEG with <code>Compression Ratio = 50</code></p>.
